    title: "The weight of period poverty in Europe"
    text: "In 2025, period poverty is still a burden for millions of Europeans and a public health emergency"
  first_part: "<b>In the 27 countries of the European Union (EU), there are nearly 112 million people who menstruate.</b> These are European figures we rarely see brought together‚Äîbecause in fact, periods are a topic that remains largely unspoken in the EU.<br/><br/>
  Today, <b>May 28, 2025</b>, the International Menstrual Health and Hygiene Day, we want to highlight the weight of period poverty and taboo in Europe through the publication of an exclusive survey and actions in European public spaces.<br/><br/>
  Because in 2025, <b>more than half of Europeans still consider menstruation a taboo topic.</b>"
  second_part: "<br/>The taboo surrounding periods starts with avoiding the subject. In Europe, like elsewhere, we don‚Äôt name periods‚Äîand if we do, we use euphemisms and images : <i>Rote Welle</i> (the red wave), <i>Niagara Falls</i>, <i>le mie cose</i> (my things), are just a few examples among more than 5000. While some of these expressions may sound funny, they are actually the first sign of a broader taboo‚Äîone that grows into hiding a pad up your sleeve, not daring to raise your hand in class to ask to use the bathroom, having to stay home during your period, or being mocked because of a visible bloodstain.<br/><br/>
  And while the <b><i>‚ÄúWeight of Period poverty in Europe‚Äù</i></b> study confirms how deeply entrenched this taboo still is in European mindsets, it also underscores the urgent need to put periods on the political and social agenda, as the taboo has a massive impact on gender inequalities. From period poverty to the neglect of menstrual pain, Europe is far from immune to the harmful effects of misinformation and ignorance.<br/><br/>
  <b>Today, among the 112 million people who menstruate in Europe, 42% are experiencing period poverty.</b><br/><br/>
  Period poverty means lacking access to enough menstrual products, information and access to basic social and health services to live with dignity and comfort during your cycle. It means that nearly <b>50 million women and other people who menstruate in Europe</b> are forced to use inadequate alternatives. This number encompasses a wide range of situations that vary from country to country, and none of them should ever be ignored or dismissed‚Äîbecause even one person experiencing period poverty is already one too many. Rags, toilet paper, newspaper, or the overuse of menstrual products ‚Äîthese coping strategies can cause serious health issues and lasting psychological consequences."
  third_part: "<br/>Menstruation comes at a cost, and <b>that cost is not affordable for everyone.</b>. Menstrual products‚Äîused every month for an average of forty years‚Äîshould be treated as essential goods. Yet their prices are neither regulated nor reimbursed. In the past two years, due to inflation and the rising cost of living, several European organizations have reported further increases in the price of menstrual products. <b>50 million people facing period poverty is already far too many.</b> Understanding that menstruation is a human right and not a privilege, if nothing is done now, the situation is likely to worsen across the EU.<br/><br/>
  Alongside this deeply unequal and harmful reality, we must add that in <b>just the past year, 53% of people who menstruate in Europe have repeatedly missed daily activities due to severe period pain.</b> We remember that pain at any stage of the menstrual cycle is not normal.<br/><br/> 
  It means that <b>more than 50 million people</b> miss school, work, or sports because their periods are too painful. Imagine you‚Äôre preparing for your end-of-year exams‚Äîthe ones that determine whether you move up a grade. Yet every month, you're doubled over with cramps, suffering from headaches that cloud your thinking, or bleeding so heavily you faint.<br/><br/>
  And many people have no idea what is causing this pain, due to the lack of scientific research, medical carelessness and therefore late diagnoses. In fact, <b>1 in 2 people who menstruate have never even heard of conditions that may be related to their cycle</b>. A lack of information, awareness, and access to menstrual health care continues to be a <b>major barrier</b> for millions of Europeans."
  fourth_part: "<br/>What can you do when you‚Äôve always been told it‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to suffer during your period? When you‚Äôre denied a prescription to diagnose adenomyosis or endometriosis? When you end up in the hospital because you didn‚Äôt know wearing a tampon for more than four hours could be dangerous? If the places where <b>women, girls, and all menstruating people live, work, and learn</b> continue to ignore their realities‚Äîif no research is done to relieve their pain, if they don‚Äôt even dare speak up for fear or shame ‚Äî <b>how can we believe they have the same opportunities?</b><br/><br/>
  From Brussels to Naples, from Tallinn to Dublin, and all across Europe, in cities and rural areas alike, millions experience menstruation as an economic, health and social burden.<br/><br/>
  The European Union‚Äôs values are founded on equality, social rights, access to healthcare, and respect for citizens. It is therefore unacceptable for the EU to overlook menstrual health.<b> In 2025, it is time to make periods a European issue.</b><br/><br/>
  We are calling on MEPs, commissioners, Council of Europe representatives, and all EU institutions to take action by:"

Each and every one of us is committed to the mission of creating more equality and providing low-threshold support and education around period poverty and menstruation. Our members have been collecting donations since 2016 to supply people in need with menstrual and hygiene products. In addition, we collaborate with artists, gynecologists, schools, and companies to raise awareness. The topic of menstruation and period poverty needs more social awareness and attention.<br/>
      What exactly do we do?<br/>
      Close communication with homeless shelters and social institutions allows us to know when and where there is a need. This way, we can ensure that donations reach the places where they are most needed. We supply emergency shelters, such as those run by GEBEWO, Berliner Stadtmission, SKF, and the German Red Cross (DRK), directly with menstrual and hygiene products through our crowdfunding page on betterplace.org. In the past, we have also received donations from companies in Germany, such as the Smiling Kangaroohs wine shop in Berlin, Signavio GmbH, Tagesspiegel and others. Through our online community on Instagram and Facebook, we provide education on period poverty and generally on topics such as menstruation, equality, and more. In regular online live sessions, meet-ups, and interviews, our team and community members raise awareness on topics like intersexuality, pregnancy, homelessness, and sexuality. We also offer workshops for companies, schools, and events to engage as many parts of society as possible on this issue."

      content: "D√¥stojn√° men≈°tru√°cia began as a civic initiative during Slovakia‚Äôs first Covid-19 lockdown in March 2020. At that time, the government decided to quarantine marginalized Roma communities, mistakenly believing they would be the primary spreaders of the virus ‚Äî an action that was later recognized as unjust and in violation of human rights. Many Slovak Roma live in extremely poor housing conditions, with limited or no access to clean running water or electricity. During the lockdown, it became clear that for many, basic facilities like toilets and clean running water were only accessible at schools or workplaces.<br/>
      In response, we organized our first fundraiser in 2020 through which we supplied menstrual products for those affected by period poverty. In 2021 we joined organization InTYMYta and in 2023 we transitioned into a full-time project. Today, we distribute essential menstrual products directly to schools, community centers, and organizations supporting people in need across Slovakia ‚Äî reaching over 61 locations so far.<br/>
      Together with Spolka collective we have also developed our own design for a durable Period Cabinet (Men≈°truaƒçn√° Skrinka), which is now installed at 31 indoor and outdoor sites. To support broader access, the design is available as an open-source manual, empowering anyone to build their own.<br/>
      In addition to direct aid, we focus strongly on education and advocacy. Our organization, Intymyta, is the leader in comprehensive sexual education (CSE) in Slovakia. We deliver workshops for students, parents, teachers, and healthcare professionals, and we are committed to advancing research and advocacy around menstrual exclusion and dignity."
